# 2. explore variable importance, variable selection, and data wrangling options

# 3. Redefine response variables used to rank players in mock draft
## e.g., use AP readiness score, or aggregate of different metrics in ranking
## currently using avg. of Z-score for Overall_Win_perc and Z-score for NFL-rushing-avg
